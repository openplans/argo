# Argo [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/openplans/argo.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/openplans/argo)

Argo is an experimental way to help people make maps more easily. Technically, it's a few Backbone views that take a config file [(here's an example)](https://github.com/openplans/argo/blob/master/src/js/demo-data.js) defining map options, GeoJson urls, and style rules. Practically, it allows people generate open source maps without (much) custom coding. GeoJson + style config = automagic map.

Initially, we plan to integrate this with [PlanningPress](http://openplans.org/projects/planningpress/) to enable planning agencies to make maps through a simple WordPress interface, but this could be used in anywhere.

This is very alpha and has no guarantees. Have fun!
